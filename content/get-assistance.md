Seek support from fellow New Yorkers in your neighborhood and beyond.
There are two ways you can use this website to get assistance:

Find a group on your own
Use the map and lists on this page to find a group who is working in your community. Reach out directly to this group so someone in your neighborhood can help you quickly.

FIND A GROUP
Request assistance through Mutual Aid NYC
Fill out a form to have Mutual Aid NYC help connect you to people in your area who are working to respond around COVID-19. We will only share your info with others doing mutual aid in New York, which might include linking you to an existing group within the network, or supporting you to start a new one. We won’t use or share your info for any other purpose.

We are experiencing a high volumes of request and it may take us multiple days to get back to you. For urgent requests, we encourage you to find and reach out to your local groups here.

REQUEST ASSISTANCE
A few notes:
We are still getting our intake and fundraising systems up and running, so right this moment we cannot respond to your request immediately.

Check here see if there is a group close to you who you might be able to reach out directly.

We aren’t able to cover big financial needs like rent or lost wages.

So many people are in crisis right now because we live in a broken world, and that’s something no one group can solve. We are working with advocacy groups who are fighting to make bigger changes for all of us, and we hope you’ll link up with them to fight for these bigger solutions.

Here is a good list of financial resources.

The request form is and will be available only in English, even though our network will provide translation and interpretation in as many languages as we can.

We don’t want to silo requests for support into different languages because that reduces the number of people who can link up to provide that support by a lot. If the person who needs support is monolingual in a language other than English, someone else should help them fill out this form, indicate language needs, and MANYC will make sure to connect in that language.
Stay strong, stay safe, stay loving! And stay tuned for updates.
